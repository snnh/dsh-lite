/**
 * The `anthropic-messages` wire: request assembly and the pairing repair every
 * durable history needs before it crosses this protocol.
 *
 * Two rules of the Messages API are not properties of the conversation but of
 * the request, and a durable session can violate both: every `tool_use` block
 * must be answered by exactly one `tool_result`, and that result must arrive in
 * the user turn that immediately follows its call. A history written across an
 * interrupted turn, a crash, or a compaction boundary can carry a result whose
 * call is gone, two results for one call, or a call nothing ever answered —
 * and the endpoint answers any of them with a 400 rather than a completion.
 * The translation therefore repairs the pairing on the way out: orphan results
 * are dropped, a repeated call id or result id collapses to its first
 * occurrence, an unanswered call is answered with a placeholder, and the
 * results of one parallel batch merge into the single user turn the protocol
 * requires. The endpoint then reads a request it would have accepted from a
 * well-formed conversation, without the durable log being rewritten.
 *
 * The other half of the port is replay fidelity: this protocol returns signed
 * thinking blocks, and returning a turn without its signature is itself a 400.
 * A signature is kept as adapter-private replay metadata on the assistant
 * message — the one place the harness reserves for exactly this — and is read
 * back only for the provider and model that produced it.
 *
